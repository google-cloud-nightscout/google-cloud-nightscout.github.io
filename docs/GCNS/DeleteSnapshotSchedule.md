# Delete Google Cloud snapshot schedule  
[Google Cloud Nightscout](../GoogleCloud.md) >> Delete Snapshot Schedule

As of April 2025, a snapshot schedule is automatically created when you set up a new virtual machine. Snapshots are not free.  
  
Before deleting a snapshot schedule, you must first detach it from the disk. The following clip demonstrates how to do this:

Once the schedule is deleted, you may still incur charges if existing snapshots remain. To avoid these charges, be sure to delete any remaining snapshots as well.
