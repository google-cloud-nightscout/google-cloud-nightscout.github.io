You will need a Google account, a Google project, and activated billing for the Google project.  We will take care of all that now.  There are also video clips (silent) on this page that may be helpful if the instructions are not clear.  
You will need 5-15 minutes to complete this.  
  
Create a Google account if you don't have one already.  
  
Go to  [https://console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) and log in with your Google account.  
When you see the welcome message, agree and continue.
