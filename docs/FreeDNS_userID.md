# What is my FreeDNS user ID?
[Google Cloud Nightscout](./GoogleCloud.md) >> FreeDNS user ID  

You can use your email address to log into FreeDNS in a browser.  However, during the installation phase 2, you will need your FreeDNS user ID.  
  
If you donâ€™t remember your FreeDNS user ID, you can find it by logging into [FreeDNS](https://freedns.afraid.org/menu/). Your user ID will be displayed at the top right pane.

Alternatively, check the verification email you received when you first signed up for FreeDNS; it includes your user ID.   
  
If you have already completed the installation, you can find your FreeDNS user ID and password on the [status page](./Status.md) by selecting `Login Credentials` at the bottom.
