#### **Important Considerations**  
This guide provides information specifically about Google Cloud Nightscout. While there are other alternatives available, the decision on whether this is the right option for you rests solely with you. The primary goal is to select the best solution to manage your or your loved one’s diabetes in consultation with a medical professional. It is important to avoid external pressure from individuals advocating for specific products. Please note, we have no financial ties to this software.  
  
#### **Billing Information**  
To set up Google Cloud Nightscout, you will need a credit card for billing. The [cost](../NS_FreeTier.md) is minimal—approximately $0.02 per month or less.  However, you will occasionally receive a credit as well.  The overall annual fee is 0.  
  
#### **Installation Overview**  
To complete the setup, you’ll need to follow the installation steps up to the section titled “Setting up followers.” During the process, you’ll be required to navigate through various menus, and [this guide](../HowToMenu.md) provides instructions on how to use them. If you have followers, make sure to complete the final installation step afterward.  
  
The full setup will take approximately 90 minutes. However, you can pause after completing each section and resume later as needed.  
  
#### **Video clips**  
Video clips are included to assist with the setup process. These clips are silent. To enlarge a video, click the square icon located on the right side of the speaker symbol at the bottom of the video frame.
