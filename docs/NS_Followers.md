# Setting up followers on Google Cloud
[Google Cloud Nightscout](./GoogleCloud.md) >> Setting up followers  
  
You can always use a web browser to view the readings from your Nightscout site. Simply enter the hostname into the browser and authenticate using your API_SECRET or token when prompted.  
  
Using tokens is the most secure method. Granting public access to your site is not recommended.  
Details on how to manage tokens can be found [here](https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Nightscout/Tokens.html).  
  
Additionally, granting public access to your site may allow web crawlers to index it, which can significantly increase traffic. To keep your Nightscout project free, it’s important to minimize traffic.
