### ‚ùå Handling Virtual Machine Creation Errors  
If you see a red exclamation mark after creating your virtual machine and hovering over it shows an error message stating that the instance is unavailable, follow these steps:  

1- Dismiss the request by clicking the trash can icon on the right.  
2- Reattempt creation in a different region.  
3- Unfortunately, you will need to reconfigure all settings from scratch for the new request.
