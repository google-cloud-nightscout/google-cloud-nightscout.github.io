# Free Trial has ended - Upgrade your account
[Google Cloud Nightscout](./GoogleCloud) >> Free Trial End  
  
You should upgrade Google Cloud to avoid any surprises.  
If you don't upgrade, you will receive an email notification as shown below when your free trial ends.  Click on "Upgrade now".

Go to the console and the Compute Engine.  You will see that the virtual machine has been stopped!  
![VM_Stopped](./images/VM_Stopped.png)  
  
Start it (one of the options under the 3-dot menu).  After the machine starts, you may notice that you still cannot access Nightscout.  This is because restarting the machine after it was shut down for a while has resulted in the machine IP address to have been changed.  
Please be patient.  It may take a minute or two, after restarting the virtual machine, for the new IP address to be associated with your hostname.

**Don't wait to upgrade**  
To avoid a surprise interruption in your Nightscout operation, upgrade before your free trial period ends.

You will not lose your remaining free credit.  You can use your remaining free credit up to its original expiry date.  
Since you have already upgraded, nothing will be interrupted when your free trial ends.  
As long as you satisfy the free tier requirements, everything will be free.
