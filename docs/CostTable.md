You can get a categorized list of costs from Google Cloud even before your free trial period ends.  You must have [created a Google Project and activated billing](./NS_GCProject.md) for this to work.

#### **How to create a cost table**

#### **How to use the cost table**  
Open the csv file you downloaded.  If you don't have Excel, you can use Open Office (free).

For many of the costs listed in the table at the top, you will see corresponding credits, due to free tier, in the table at the bottom.  Those have been highlighted in pink and green in the example table shown above respectively.   Ignoring those, what remains will be what you are charged for.  
In case of the cost table shown above, that is the $0.27 cost due to snapshots.  
  
See what the SKU description is for each.  If it is unexpected, please [contact us](./GCNS_Support.md).  

Any credit listed as "free tier" is independent of your free trial.  Even after your free trial period ends, all free tier credits remain and stay in effect.
