#### **Why have I been charged?**  
Google Cloud Nightscout is free in some months, but in others you may see a small charge of about $0.03.  
A credit card is required to set up billing.  
This page explains the details and points out incorrect settings that could lead to higher costs.  
To find the exact reason for any charges, create a [cost table](./CostTable.md).

#### **Free Trial**
When you first sign up for Google Cloud, you can enable the free trial program, which gives you $300 in credits for a 3-month period. During this time, any costs will be covered by this credit. You can monitor your spending through the billing dashboard.  
If your costs are higher than expected, stopping the virtual machine before the trial ends can help avoid actual charges.
