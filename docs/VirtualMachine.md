For additional assistance, a video clip on this page may be helpful. This process takes around 5 minutes.

Click on "Create" to create the virtual machine.  Google will now initialize your virtual machine.  Wait for it to come up.  It could take a minute.  When the external IP column appears, you should be good to go.  Your virtual machine is now ready! 🎉

### ❌ Handling Virtual Machine Creation Errors  
If you see a red exclamation mark after creating your virtual machine and hovering over it shows an error message stating that the instance is unavailable, follow these steps:  

1- Dismiss the request by clicking the trash can icon on the right.  
2- Reattempt creation in a different region.  
3- Unfortunately, you will need to reconfigure all settings from scratch for the new request.
